              <strong>Mechanical & Electrical Design Intern</strong><br>
              Jul. 2024 - Oct. 2024 | Prague, Czech Republic
            </p>
            <p>
              During my internship, I focused on reengineering the thermoelectric cooler (TEC) mount within the SHG vacuum chamber of the L1 Allegra laser system. I also redesigned the TEC controller enclosure to enhance safety, improve diagnostics, and optimize airflow for better component cooling. This work involved using Siemens NX for design, Ansys for thermal simulations, LabVIEW for system control, as well as gaining experience with 3D printing, CNC machining, and electrical wiring.

            </p>
            <p>  
              I designed and built electronic circuits using STM and AVR microcontrollers, creating custom PCBs with KiCAD. I programmed in C and Python for system functionality, and used the Red Pitaya for signal generation, acquisition, and processing. I ran electronic and optical experiments using advanced lab equipment, and designed components like a laser post generator in Fusion 360, combining precision engineering with practical application.

            </p>
            <p>
              I set up a time-resolved IR spectroscopy system to study Ru(bpy)₃ electron transfer. I wrote MATLAB code for data processing and visualization, aligned the IR optical path, designed sample holders for different solvents and thicknesses, prepared solutions, set up samples, and ran UV-vis and IR measurements. I quickly learned wet chemistry techniques and picked up MATLAB and Python skills.

              I collaborated on designing and implementing core functionalities of an RPA bot using Robot Framework and Python. We developed the bot's capabilities to automate LinkedIn interactions, integrate an API for personalized messages, and handle dynamic web elements with JavaScript. We resolved CSS selection issues caused by LinkedIn's dynamic interface and fixed data formatting errors during API integration, allowing the bot to successfully navigate profiles, extract names, send personalized messages, and save profile data.

            <p>  
              During the Anatolian Rover Challenge 2022, we showcased the Scorpio X rover, securing 1st place overall. I tested soil samples for signs of life, presented results with data and photos, and provided technical support. I also worked on developing multiple rovers, handling soil testing, experiment design, and science module research, while maintaining and using 3D printers for prototyping.
